/** @fileoverview Scrolling capture: scrolls a window and stitches what
 *  it shows into one tall image.
 *
 *  The loop runs on its own thread. It scrolls the page with a virtual
 *  pointer, waits for each step to settle, and keeps a step only once the
 *  stitcher has verified how far the content really moved. When the page
 *  cannot be scrolled automatically, or the user takes the mouse, it carries
 *  on with what the user scrolls by hand. Capture only moves down the page. */
